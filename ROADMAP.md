## Feature ideas
- save/restore state!!! (ugh)

- restore state from target
- add new behaviours at runtime

## Improvements
- use pubsub for tick
- uniform error handling
- dashboard: better terminal renderer
- fix module redefinition

## Just thinking
- rename behavior to personality to avoid confusion with elixir's behaviour keyword
- rename project to beamulator

## Done

- destroy actors tool + example ✅
- spawn actors at runtime ✅
